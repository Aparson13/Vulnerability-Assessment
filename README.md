# Vulnerability

## Background Information
This is another project from my coursework in the Cyber Security Boot Camp at the University of Richmond. Here, I conducted a vulnerability assessment doing both parts of the Red Team and the Blue Team. The Red Team reconnassiance include mapping the Network Topology, Vulnerabilities Assessments, and then Vulnerability Exploitation. From the Blue Team side, I used Kibana Elastic Search to log the attacks enacted by the Red Team. From here, I was able to analyze the attacks and conveyed mitigations to these vulnerabilities.

## Tools Used
- Kibana Elastic Search
- Metasploit
- Hydra
- NMAP
